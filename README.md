# Latticefold+

THis is experimental Latticefold+ implementation.
THis is brief [introduction to latticefold+](https://hackmd.io/vM0_xErKQAS2_RC1QRMUTw)





# LatticeFold

A proof-of-concept implementation of the LatticeFold folding scheme engineered by [Nethermind](https://nethermind.io) based on the work 
[LatticeFold: A Lattice-based Folding Scheme and its Applications to Succinct Proof Systems](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/257) by Dan Boneh and Binyi Chen.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is provided "as is" and NOT ready for production use. Use at your own risk.

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks on your local machine, simply execute `cargo bench`. This will take around 48 hours.
Use `cargo bench --bench` to measure relevant parts of the protocol as well as the ajtai commitment scheme, and comment the prime fields you don't want to measure.

## Building

The [rust-toolchain](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/rust-toolchain) file pins the version of the Rust toolchain, which the LatticeFold library builds with, to the specific version `nightly-2025-03-06`.

One can install the `nightly-2025-03-06` toolchain by invoking:
```bash
rustup install nightly-2025-03-06
```

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold.git
cd latticefold
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
Import the library:
```toml
[dependencies]
latticefold = { git = "https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold.git", package = "latticefold" }
```

Available packages:
- `latticefold`: main crate, contains the non-interactive folding scheme implementation, together with the Ajtai commitment scheme, R1CS/CCS structures, Fiat-Shamir transcript machinery, etc.
- `cyclotomic-rings`: contains the trait definition of a ring suitable to be used in the LatticeFold protocol, a few ready-to-use rings and short challenge set machinery.

## Performance report
The performance report for this library can be found [here](https://nethermind.notion.site/Latticefold-and-lattice-based-operations-performance-report-153360fc38d080ac930cdeeffed69559).

## Examples

Check [latticefold/examples/README.md](latticefold/examples/README.md) for examples.

## Frontends

Currently, the only way to define a circuit to be folded is by specifying it as a [rank-1 constraint system (R1CS)](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/latticefold/src/arith/r1cs.rs) or a [customizable constraint system (CCS)](https://github.com/NethermindEth/latticefold/blob/main/latticefold/src/arith.rs).

## Acknowledgments

- This project is built on top of [our fork](https://github.com/NethermindEth/stark-rings) of [lattirust library](https://github.com/cknabs/lattirust) originally developed by [Christian Knabenhans](https://github.com/cknabs) and [Giacomo Fenzi](https://github.com/WizardOfMenlo). 
- We adapted [the sumcheck protocol from Jolt](https://github.com/a16z/jolt/blob/fa45507aaddb1815bafd54332e4b14173a7f8699/jolt-core/src/subprotocols/sumcheck.rs#L35) to the ring setting. 
- A lot of definitions are directly transferred from [sonobe](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/sonobe) library. 
- The implementation is supported by Ethereum Foundation [ZK Grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/25/zk-grants-round-announce).
